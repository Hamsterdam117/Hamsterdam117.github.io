<p class="project-intro" style="margin-bottom: 8em;">This was a racing game I made for one of my A level courseworks using the Unity game engine. As it was for coursework I'm not sure if I'm allowed to show code screenshots so I will just have to explain how things were programmed, but it was a lot UI based as well so shouldn't be too hard to follow.</p>

<p class="project-intro">Currently all the screenshots I have from the game are really low-res as the game was made on my old MacBook, so I will write this page when I get Unity installed on my PC and can take some clearer and more specific screenshots.</p>
