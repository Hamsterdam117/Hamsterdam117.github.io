			<h1>GuitarTabTool</h1>

			<p class='project-intro'>I started making this project while in my Year in Industry working for Lucid Games, where I was using Unreal Engine 4 and 5 constantly so got fairly good at it and C++. As I was working full time during the time I made this, I mostly worked on it at weekends and some evenings as C++ and UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) practice and for my own use. I'm really pleased with how it has come out, as it has matched my initial idea of what it would be pretty perfectly, and it's really easy to use and make good looking and clear tab sheets which are great for learning guitar from. It isn't perfect, and could do with a rewrite now I am more experienced with C++ and Unreal Engine to be more modular and extensible. I haven't been very good at documenting the process of this project, but here are some pictures of the software.</p>
