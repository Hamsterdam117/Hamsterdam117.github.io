At some point I want to remake this game now I have more computing power than a Macbook but I want to make all of my own assets, I might wait until after university but I'm not sure yet.",

							"<p class='project-intro'>This was a racing game I made for one of my A level courseworks using the Unity game engine. As it was for coursework I'm not sure if I'm allowed to show code screenshots so I will just have to explain how things were programmed, but it was a lot UI based as well so shouldn't be too hard to follow.</p>",
							"<p class='project-intro'>Currently all the screenshots I have from the game are really low-res as the game was made on my old MacBook, so I will write this page when I get Unity installed on my PC and can take some clearer and more specific screenshots.</p>"
