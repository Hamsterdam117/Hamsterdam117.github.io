			"display_description":"I started getting back into playing guitar during 2021, and wanted to make tab sheets of songs I learnt from YouTube in a way that wasnt unnecessarily difficult or costing me money, so I just made my own tool in UE5 (yes I know a game engine isn't the usual way to make this sort of thing but I'm good at C++ now and didn't want to re-learn JavaScript so here we are).",
			"content_html": [
							"<p class='project-intro'>I started making this project while in my Year in Industry working for Lucid Games, where I was using Unreal Engine 4 and 5 constanly so got fairly good at it and C++. As I was working full time during the time I made this, I mostly worked on it at weekends and some evenings as C++ and UMG (Unreal Motion Graphics) practice and for my own use. I'm really pleased with how it has come out, as it has matched my initial idea of what it would be pretty perfectly, and it's really easy to use and make good looking and clear tab sheets which are great for learning guitar from. I'll probably put this up on GitHub at some point, or maybe I'll publish it on the Microsoft/Apple Stores, not sure yet.</p>"
