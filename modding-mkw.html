<p class="project-intro" style="margin-bottom: 8em;">This one probably requires a bit of backstory, so back when I was in primary school, our family had a Nintendo Wii. Mario Kart Wii (MKW) was (and still is) my favourite game on the system and still remains one of my favourite games of all time. I got back into it again during my first year at University when I put it in the kitchen/social area of my flat to play various Wii games with my flatmates and during the summer holidays after my first year I started modding it to add characters, tracks and the ability to play online again since the servers got shut down years ago.</p>
